🎬  <ins> Movies Database — Python Project </ins>

A simple command-line application that allows you to manage a personal movie database.
All movie data is stored inside a JSON file called data.json, which acts as the project’s database.

The application uses helper functions from movie_storage.py to load, save, and modify the data.
These functions handle reading and writing to the JSON file, so the main program only works with Python dictionaries.
